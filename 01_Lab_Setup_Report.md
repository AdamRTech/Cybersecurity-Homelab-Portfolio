# CyberSecurtiy Lab Environment Configuration 
This progect is matters to a business becouse it allows you to practice labs in a safe and controlled environment. With this you are able to practice things such as "**Incident Responce**" and a multitude of "**Security Opperations**." 

The VMs that i created are as follows:
- Kali (**4GB RAM**)
- Ubuntu (**4GB RAM**)
- Win11 (**4GB RAM**)

I created three so that there can be an **Attacker**, **DB Target**, and **Endpoint Target**.
